# regfile_minmax

Investigating the area-scaling behaviour of parameterizable register files synthesised with **Yosys** targeting the **IHP SG13G2 130 nm** open-source standard-cell PDK.

Analyzes RegFile scaling behavior similar to:

> Zyuban V., Kogge P. (1998). *The Energy Complexity of Register Files.*
> Proceedings of the 1998 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (**ISLPED '98**).
> DOI [10.1145/280756.280943](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/280756.280943)

The paper characterises register-file area and power as scaling roughly as O(N·P²) where N is the register count and P = Nᵣ + N_w is the total port count.

We check whether this prediction matches modern PDKs.

## Todo/Questions

- [ ] Why are we sqrt with respect to ports? This means we're sublinear. That doesn't make sense.

## Key findings

| Metric | Paper (custom VLSI) | This work (std-cell, Yosys + IHP SG13G2) |
|---|---|---|
| Area ~ P^α  (port scaling) | α ≈ 2.0 | **α ≈ 0.55** |
| Area vs bit-width | Linear | Linear ✓ |
| Area vs register count | Linear–super-linear | Near-linear ✓ |
| Banking reduces area? | Yes (at high port counts) | Yes ✓ |

Standard-cell synthesis is **sub-quadratic** in port count because read ports map to independent mux trees that share the same FF array — unlike custom bitcell arrays where every extra port adds physical bit-line routing.
Write ports are consistently more expensive per port than read ports in both the paper and this work.

## Results

### Port sweep (32 regs × 32-bit, IHP SG13G2)

Area as a function of read-port count (coloured by write-port count) and write-port count (coloured by read-port count):

### Area scaling — power-law fit

Log-log fit across all (Nᵣ, N_w) combinations. The fitted exponent α is shown against the paper's prediction of ≈ 2.0:

### Area heatmap

Chip area (×10³ µm²) for every (Nᵣ, N_w) combination at 32 regs × 32-bit:

### Bit-width sweep (2R1W, 32 regs)

Area scales linearly with bit-width, matching the paper's prediction:

### Register count sweep (2R1W, 32-bit)

Area is near-linear in register count (slight super-linearity from deeper address muxes):

### Banking sweep (32 regs × 32-bit)

Read-port banking: each bank stores all registers but serves only Nᵣ / NUM_BANKS read ports.
Higher port counts see a greater benefit from banking (right panel: normalised to 1-bank baseline):

## Quick start

### 1 · Build and enter the container

```bash
docker compose run regfile-study
```

### 2 · Run the full analysis flow (recommended)

```bash
make plot
```

### 3 · Interactive Plotly notebook

From **outside** the container (or a second terminal):

```bash
docker compose up jupyter
# open http://localhost:8888 → notebooks/analysis.ipynb
```

### Smoke test (single synthesis)

```bash
make smoke
```

### Python-based calls

For custom debugging or ad-hoc runs, the Python scripts can still be used
directly:

```bash
# All sweeps
python flow/run_sweep.py --sweep all

# Single sweep
python flow/run_sweep.py --sweep port

# Regenerate plots from summary.csv
python flow/generate_plots.py
```

## RTL parameters

### `regfile` (flat)

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NUM_RD_PORTS` | 2 | Simultaneous read ports (async) |
| `NUM_WR_PORTS` | 1 | Simultaneous write ports (sync) |
| `BITWIDTH` | 32 | Register width in bits |
| `NUM_REGS` | 32 | Number of registers |

### `regfile_banked`

All parameters of `regfile`, plus:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NUM_BANKS` | 2 | Number of banks (`NUM_RD_PORTS` must be divisible by `NUM_BANKS`) |

Banking strategy: each bank is a full copy of `regfile` with `NUM_RD_PORTS/NUM_BANKS` read ports.
All write ports are broadcast to every bank. The trade-off is ×`NUM_BANKS` FF area against smaller per-bank mux trees.
